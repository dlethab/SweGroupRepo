# SweGroupRepo
This is the repository to be used by our group in Dr. Narayanasami's CS 3354.004 class. This repository will contain all code to be used by 


github related steps for phase 1:

  Link for the Google document : Goal of this task is to mimic software development by a small team of Software Engineers.
      Find the code for open source software / even past assignments (from other courses) that has same or more # of files compared to         your team size.    Download, compile and test it out.
      
  Now distribute the files among the team members.
  
  Use Git and GitHub to create local & remote public repository. There are a tons of online resources to help you, if you are new to       Git/GitHub. Here are a few:
    https://www.w3schools.com/git
    https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-git-and-github-in-a-team-like-a-pro
    
  Designate one person as the team lead - that person can create the repository in GitHub and add all other team members as                collaborators.
  
  Now, each team member can submit the "assigned" files to the repository.
  
  Finally, each team member can pull the latest code from GitHub and build everything locally. Repeat the testing done in step #1.
